**Foxglove helps robotics teams explore, collaborate on, and make sense of their robots' data – for more intelligent iteration and accelerated development.**

## Workflows

Foxglove provides a wide array of developer tooling for every step of the robotics development process.

- **Record**
  - Record multimodal data in a variety of encoding formats (MCAP, ROS 1, ROS 2, Protobuf, etc.)
- **Ingest**
  - Import recordings from local machines and edge sites into a central cloud repository
- **Process**
  - Index the data by device, time, and topic
  - Set retention policies to manage your team's data store
  - Configure webhooks to integrate with the rest of your data pipeline
- ## **Visualize**
  - Configure [panels](/docs/visualization/panels/introduction) to understand how your robots sense, think, and act
  - Create shared [layouts](/docs/visualization/layouts) for tackling repeated visualization and debugging tasks
- **Collaborate**
  - Annotate logs with [metadata and events](/docs/events) for easier search and discovery
  - Rely on collective knowledge to triage incidents and analyze the root cause of an issue

### Getting started

- Record multimodal data using a variety of [supported encoding formats](/docs/connecting-to-data/local-data#supported-formats)
  - [MCAP](https://mcap.dev) allows multiple streams of structured and unstructured data in one file (e.g. ROS, Protobuf, JSON Schema, etc.)
- [Import](/docs/importing-data) local data recordings, organized by timestamp and recording [device](/docs/devices)
- Annotate [recordings](/docs/recordings) with metadata and [events](/docs/events)
- Arrange and configure [panels](/docs/visualization/panels/introduction) into custom visualization and debugging [layouts](/docs/visualization/layouts)
- [Stream imported data](/connecting-to-data/imported-data) to Foxglove and [third-party tools like Jupyter Notebooks](/docs/integrations/jupyter-notebooks) for analysis
