    "To load remote data into Foxglove Studio, you must host your files in a server or cloud provider that supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and accepts range requests.",
};

When loading remote data into Foxglove Studio for playback and analysis, we recommend hosting your files in a cloud provider like [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/), [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage), or [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/storage/). You can also host files on your own server, but it may be difficult and time-consuming to set up support for [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://web.dev/cross-origin-resource-sharing/) and [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests).

If your data is sensitive, generate and use a signed URL – make sure that you point to the resource directly, as redirects will not work with CORS:

- For S3 – [Sharing objects using presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)
- For GCS – [Signed URLS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)
- For Azure Storage – [Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview)

This signed URL will work for a limited period of time, and you can set up your server to only sign URLs for authenticated users.

Finally, set up your CORS configuration. Check out the following example of a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) config for an S3 bucket ([documentation here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp%20%20/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_cors_configuration)):

```
cors_rule {
  allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
  allowed_origins = ["https://studio.foxglove.dev"]
  allowed_headers = ["*"]
  expose_headers = ["ETag", "Content-Type", "Accept-Ranges", "Content-Length"]
}
```

And a Terraform config for a GCS bucket ([documentation here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket#cors)):

```
cors {
  origin = ["https://studio.foxglove.dev"]
  method = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
  response_header = ["ETag", "Content-Type", "Accept-Ranges", "Content-Length"]
}
```
