To take your robots out of the lab and into production, you must first have a deep understanding of how they sense, think, and act.

This is impossible without observability. Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system from its generated data. With observability, teams can accelerate development, quickly diagnose hardware and software issues, and confidently ship features to improve fleet performance.

**As a robotics observability platform, Foxglove helps teams explore, understand, and collaborate on their multimodal data more efficiently.** The platform streamlines common development and debugging workflows – across industries as diverse as agriculture, autonomous driving, and warehouse automation – to accelerate robotics companies' time to market.
