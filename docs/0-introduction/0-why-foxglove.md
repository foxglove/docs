title: Why Foxglove?
---

To iterate on your robots, you must first understand how they're navigating their world.

Foxglove helps robotics teams explore, visualize, and analyze their multimodal data efficiently. As a robotics observability platform, it streamlines development workflows to significantly accelerate your time to market.

Foxglove can run as a [cross-platform desktop app](https://foxglove.dev/download) (Linux, Windows, and macOS), [hosted web app](https://studio.foxglove.dev/), or [self-hosted web app](TBD) on your own domain.

## Navigate dense multimodal data

Foxglove takes the dizzying array of tools that robotics development usually requires, and integrates them into one seamless developer environment. Choose from a rich selection of data visualization and debugging tools to compose team-specific dashboards for your entire organization to use. You can even contribute custom plugins like [extensions](TBD) and [user scripts](TBD) to make sure your Foxglove setup address your team's project-specific and ever-evolving needs.

## Highlight points of interest

Data should be easy to manage – especially as your team grows and your fleet scales. Foxglove provides a web interface and API to help you navigate this data.

Foxglove's automatic data partitioning and indexing helps you retrieve just the information you need at lightning speed. Locate events of interest by simply querying for a robot ID and time range, and annotate results with useful tags for even faster analysis.

## Collaborate with team members

Having one central and secure data repository makes it easy for everyone on the team to know where the data lives – regardless of who first uploaded it and who currently needs to access it.

Foxglove also makes it easy to share and reuse work across the team – from visualization layouts, custom user scripts, or bespoke extensions.
