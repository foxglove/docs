To take your robots out of the lab and into production, you must first understand how they sense, think, and act. To accomplish this, you need observability – the ability to understand the internal state of a system from its generated data.

**As a robotics observability platform, Foxglove helps teams explore, collaborate on, and ultimately make sense of their data more efficiently.**

The platform streamlines common development and debugging workflows – across industries as diverse as agriculture, autonomous driving, and warehouse automation. It helps roboticists diagnose issues faster, ship features more confidently, and improve fleet performance consistently iteration after iteration.

With Foxglove, robotics teams can spend less time worrying about their developer tooling and more time on getting to market fast.
