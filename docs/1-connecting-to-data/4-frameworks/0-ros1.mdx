Load local and remote [ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu) (`.bag`) files, or connect directly to a live ROS 1 stack.

## Live data

[Install ROS 1](https://foxglove.dev/blog/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu), and make sure you are on the same network as the robot.

In Foxglove, select "Open connection" in the "Open data source" dialog.

### Foxglove WebSocket

We recommend [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) as the easiest way to get connected – especially if you have a network firewall between ROS and Foxglove, as it requires your ROS host to have only one port open.

This option requires running an extra ROS node ([`foxglove_bridge`](https://index.ros.org/p/foxglove_bridge/)) – follow the [installation directions here](/docs/connecting-to-data/foxglove-bridge).

#### Connect

[Set up the Foxglove bridge](/docs/connecting-to-data/ros-foxglove-bridge).

Select "Foxglove WebSocket" in the "Open data source" dialog, then enter the URL to your Rosbridge server:

#### Limitations

Foxglove WebSocket connections support publishing back to your ROS stack, but not reading or setting ROS parameters.

### Rosbridge
_NOTE: For performance reasons, we recommend using the [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) connection instead._

<RosbridgeDirections rosVersion={1}/>

#### Limitations

Rosbridge connections support publishing back to your ROS stack, but not reading or setting [ROS parameters](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/issues/1662).

### Native

<DesktopAppOnlyBadge />

_NOTE: Docker for Mac unfortunately does not expose all container ports to the macOS host, and so does not support [bridge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-macos) or [host networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/). When running ROS on a Mac, use the [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) or the [Rosbridge](#rosbridge) connection instead._

Connect directly to your running ROS stack via a native TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to access your ROS master and/or nodes directly.

Once you have a working [ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu) setup on your computer, run `roscore` in your terminal to start your ROS master.

Select "ROS 1" in the "Open data source" dialog, and enter your [`ROS_MASTER_URI`](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_MASTER_URI) (ROS master's IP and port) and [`ROS_HOSTNAME`](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_IP.2FROS_HOSTNAME):

![ROS 1 dialog](/img/docs/connecting-to-data/ros1.png)

If you're experiencing any issues, ensure you have unrestricted network connectivity between your ROS stack and Foxglove, as ROS uses multiple ports to communicate.

If you're running ROS and Foxglove on different machines see the ROS 1 [Network Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup) docs to make sure your environment is configured correctly.

#### Limitations

ROS 1 connections do not yet support reading or setting [ROS parameters](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/issues/1662).

### Remote file

Select "Remote file" in the "Open data source" dialog, and enter the URL to your remote `.bag` file.
