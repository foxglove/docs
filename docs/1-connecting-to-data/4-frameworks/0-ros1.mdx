Foxglove can load local and remote [ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu) (`.bag`) files, or connect directly to a running ROS stack using a Rosbridge (WebSockets) or native (TCP) connection.

## Files

Open ROS 1 `.bag` files from your local filesystem or a remote cloud storage solution.

### Local file

To load a local ROS 1 `.bag` file, double-click it from your file manager, drag-and-drop the file directly into the app, or _Open local file_ via the _Data source_ dialog:

### Cloud data

#### Foxglove Data Platform

Use [Foxglove Data Platform](/data-platform)'s [web console](https://console.foxglove.dev) to upload your ROS 1 `.bag` files and stream it directly into Foxglove.

Check out the [Data Platform docs](/docs/data-platform/exporting-and-visualizing-data) for more information on how to export and visualize your robotics data.

#### By URL

To load a remote ROS 1 (`.bag`) file, select _Open file from URL_ in the _Data source_ dialog, and enter the URL to your remote file.

## Live connection

For live connections, you must be on the same network as the robot. While we support multiple options, we recommend [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) as the easiest option to get started.

### Foxglove WebSocket

Connect directly to your running ROS stack using a Foxglove WebSocket connection. This connection uses a standard protocol to connect Foxglove to your ROS master over WebSockets. While it does require running an extra ROS node ([`foxglove_bridge`](https://index.ros.org/p/foxglove_bridge/)), we recommend this option if you have a network firewall between ROS and Foxglove, as it requires your ROS host to have only one port open.

#### Connecting to data

[Install ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu) and follow the instructions for [setting up the Foxglove bridge](/docs/studio/connection/using-foxglove-bridge).

_Open connection_ in the _Data source_ dialog, select _Foxglove WebSocket_, then enter the URL to your Rosbridge server:

#### Current limitations

Foxglove WebSocket connections support publishing back to your ROS stack, but not reading or setting ROS parameters.

### Rosbridge

_NOTE: For performance reasons, we recommend using the [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) connection instead._

Connect directly to your running ROS stack via WebSockets using a Rosbridge connection. This connection option requires only a single open port between Foxglove and your robot.

A [`rosbridge`](https://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite) connection uses a standard protocol to connect Foxglove to your ROS master over WebSockets. While it does require running an extra ROS node ([`rosbridge_server`](https://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_server)), we recommend this option if you have a network firewall between ROS and Foxglove, as it requires your ROS host to have only one port open.

To open a Rosbridge connection, make sure youâ€™ve [installed ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu), as well as [`rosbridge-suite`](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite):

```shell
# For Noetic (ROS 1)
$ sudo apt install ros-noetic-rosbridge-suite
```

Next, start the WebSocket server, and review the command printout to determine the port it is listening on (e.g. `ws://0.0.0.0:9090`):

```shell
$ roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

Click _Open connection_ in the _Data source_ dialog, select "Rosbridge (ROS 1 & 2)", then enter the URL to your Rosbridge server:

![rosbridge dialog](/img/docs/studio/connection/live-connection/rosbridge-dialog.webp)

You are now connected to ROS!

To test your connection, add a [Raw Messages panel](/docs/studio/panels/raw-messages) to your layout, and see a list of available topics populate the dropdown. Check out the `/connected_clients` topic to see information `rosbridge` is publishing about your connection.

#### Current limitations

Rosbridge connections support publishing back to your ROS stack, but not reading or setting [ROS parameters](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/issues/1662).

### Native

<DesktopAppOnlyBadge />

_NOTE: Docker for Mac unfortunately does not expose all container ports to the macOS host, and so does not support [bridge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-macos) or [host networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/). When running ROS on a Mac, use the [Foxglove WebSocket](#foxglove-websocket) or the [Rosbridge](#rosbridge) connection instead._

Connect directly to your running ROS stack via a native TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to access your ROS master and/or nodes directly.

Once you have a working [ROS 1](/tutorials/installing-ros1-on-ubuntu) setup on your computer, run `roscore` in your terminal to start your ROS master.

_Open connection_ via the _Data source_ dialog, select "ROS 1", and enter your [`ROS_MASTER_URI`](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_MASTER_URI) (ROS master's IP and port) and [`ROS_HOSTNAME`](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_IP.2FROS_HOSTNAME):

![ros 1 dialog](/img/docs/studio/connection/live-connection/ros1-dialog.webp)

If you're experiencing any issues, ensure you have unrestricted network connectivity between your ROS stack and Foxglove, as ROS uses multiple ports to communicate.

If you're running ROS and Foxglove on different machines see the ROS 1 [Network Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup) docs to make sure your environment is configured correctly.

#### Current limitations

ROS 1 connections do not yet support reading or setting [ROS parameters](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/issues/1662).
