Foxglove can connect to Velodyne Lidar hardware to load live incoming data.

_Open connection_ in the _Data source_ dialog, select the _Velodyne Lidar_ connection, then enter the local UDP port on which you want to listen for Velodyne packets:

To test your connection, add a [3D panel](/docs/studio/panels/3d) to your layout, and open your panel settings to toggle on the velodyne topic. You should now see an interactive representation of your Lidar scan in a 3D scene.
