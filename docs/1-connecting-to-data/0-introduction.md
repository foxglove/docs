Foxglove can connect to several types of live and robotics robotics data.

Once connected, you can view information about the data source – including its start time, end time, and list of topics.

## Sample data

To get a sense of what you can visualize in Foxglove before connecting to your own data, "Explore sample data" to load a [sample dataset adapted from nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) in an example layout for playback. Hover over each panel to see its name and toolbar, and seek to different places on the playback bar to see the panels update with new information.
