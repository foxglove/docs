title: Imported data
---

When you [sign up](https://console.foxglove.dev/signup) for a Foxglove organization, you will be assigned a Foxglove-hosted cloud by default.

## Setting storage region

When first signing up, you will prompted to set your Primary Site's data region to the United States or Europe. By specifying where your uploaded data files will physically live, you can ensure that your robotics data stays within your team's geography. This can aid in compliance with GDPR and other privacy requirements, giving you additional confidence in data privacy and security.

Note that this data region selection applies only to imported data files. Import metadata, user account data, and general app data are stored in Foxglove's US-based servers.

## Importing data

Your organization's data files will be imported to this cloud by default.

After [importing data recordings to Foxglove](TBD), every member of your organization can load this data for visualization.

To load individual recordings or events, select a resource on the [Recordings](https://console.foxglove.dev/recordings) or [Events](https://console.foxglove.dev/events) page and "Visualize":

To load a time range of data that potentially spans multiple recordings or events, select a data coverage bar or time range on the [Timeline](https://console.foxglove.dev/timeline) and "Visualize":
