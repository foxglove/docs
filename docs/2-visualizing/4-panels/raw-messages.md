title: Raw Messages
---

Use [message path syntax](/docs/studio/app-concepts/message-path-syntax) to specify the message path you want to inspect.

As new messages are received for a given path, the collapsible tree will show just the latest data. You will be able to expand and collapse keys, and have those changes persist across playback.

A link to the topic's schema is at the top of display for easy reference.

Drilling down to a primitive value (i.e. number, string, boolean) will display that value in large text.

### Diff mode

Compare messages by showing additions (green), deletions (red), and changes (yellow) to their fields across 3 categories:

- `"previous message"` – Compare consecutive messages for a given message path
- `"other source"` - Compare messages from different data sources for a given timestamp
- `"custom"` – Compare different topic messages for a given timestamp
