title: State Transitions
---

Track when the discrete values of topic message paths, specified using [message path syntax](/docs/studio/app-concepts/message-path-syntax), change.

When playing back a pre-recorded data source (e.g. a local or remote `.bag` file), this panel will preload the data belonging to the specified topic message paths for the whole playback timeline.

Current playback time will be indicated by a vertical gray bar.

Paths can point to any primitive value (numbers, booleans, enums, etc.), but will be most useful for ["enums"](/docs/studio/annotating-data).

**Note**: Constants included in your ROS message definition will be displayed as a label for each "enum" plot. Limit enums to one per message definition, as Foxglove will not know which constant name to use in the event of multiple matches.

## User interactions

Scroll to zoom, and drag to pan. Double-click to reset the view.

Hover over any point on a chart to see its details in a tooltip. You'll see a vertical yellow bar appear, as well as a corresponding yellow marker on the playback timeline.
