## User interactions

Filter incoming messages by:

- **Severity level** – The minimum severity of messages to show.
- **Node names or message text** – A comma-separated list of filter terms.

The severity filter is always enforced — i.e. messages below the minimum severity will never appear, even if their node names or message texts match the text filter.

The filter terms for node names or message text will execute as an `OR` – i.e. it will return messages that match any of the terms.
