Click any panel name to add it to your current layout. Alternatively, drag and drop a panel name into your current layout to add it to a specific location.

Each panel's top bar contains the following:

- Menu with common panel actions, like splitting the panel or changing it for another panel type
- Cog icon that opens that panel's settings in the sidebar
- Draggable area for easily moving the panel around your layout

## Panel settings

Click the cog icon in each panel's top bar to view and edit its settings in the sidebar's _Panel settings_ tab. You can also open the _Panel settings_ tab and click on a panel in your layout to view and edit its settings. In both cases, the selected panel will be designated with a purple border.

Clicking another panel while the _Panel settings_ tab is open will automatically display its settings in the sidebar.

For numerical fields in the panel settings interface, click and drag on focused input fields to quickly update their values.
