### Add to layout

Click any panel name to add it to your current layout. Alternatively, drag and drop a panel name into your current layout to add it to a specific location.

Each panel's top bar contains the following:

- Menu with common panel actions, like splitting the panel or changing it for another panel type
- Cog icon that opens that panel's settings in the sidebar
- Draggable area for easily moving the panel around your layout

### Edit panel settings

Click the cog icon in each panel's top bar to view and edit its settings in the sidebar. The selected panel will be designated with a purple border.
