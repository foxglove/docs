Foxglove organization admins can use the [Insights dashboard](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/insights) to understand how their team members are leveraging the platform. With this insight, the team can brainstorm ways to better leverage the product's full potential.

### Import volume

Track the net and cumulative volume of data your Foxglove organization has imported week-over-week:

This can give admins a sense of your company's data storage bill, whether you are nearing your planâ€™s data limit, and the time periods during which the team imported the most data.

### Occurring events

Track the number of events added for a given week of collected data, by week:

This can give you a sense of your data coverage, as well as whether your team is taking full advantage of this data organization and exploration strategy.
