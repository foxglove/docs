Monitor your Foxglove edge site.

### Online status

The edge site performs periodic pings to the Foxglove API control plane to report health. Organization admins can see this status on the [Sites settings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/sites).

### Prometheus

The edge site service exposes processing and memory statistics on a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics scraping endpoint on port 6002.

Check out the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview) for more information.

#### Available metrics

- `recordings_indexed` – Number of recordings indexed by the service
- `recordings_imported` – Number of recordings imported to a Primary Site
- `recordings_deleted` – Number of recordings deleted from the edge
- `recordings_gigabytes` – Volume in recordings (GB)
- `imports_gigabytes` – Volume of imported recordings (GB)
- `import_time_seconds` – Histogram of import times to the Primary Site
- `import_throughput_mbps` – Histogram of upload throughput to a Primary Site, when uploads are in progress
- `recording_summary_read_ms` – Histogram of timings for reading MCAP summary sections from storage
- `recording_stat_ms` – Histogram of timings for calling "Stat()" on MCAP files in storage
- `recording_index_ms` – Histogram of timings for indexing recordings in the sqlite database
- `deletion_mark_ms` – Histogram of timings for marking recordings for garbage collection in the index
- `deletion_sweep_ms` – Histogram of timings for physical deletion of recordings from disk
- `control_plane_patch_recordings_deleted_ms` – Histogram of timings for reporting garbage collections to the control plane
- `control_plane_post_recordings_ms` – Histogram of timings for the (async) report of recording availability to console
- `recording_upload_ms` – Histogram of timings for upload of a recording file to the configured inbox bucket
- `control_plane_patch_recordings_imported_ms` – Histogram of timings for batched status updates issued to console after submission of recordings
- `pending_import_request_poll_ms` – Histogram of timings for requests against Foxglove for pending import requests
* `database_recordings_count`: Count of recordings indexed in the database.
* `database_topics_count`: Count of unique topics/schemas indexed in the database.
* `database_recording_reports_count`: Count of recording reports indexed in the database.
* `database_size_bytes`: Total size of database in bytes.

To see a list of available metrics in your Terminal, use the `kubectl` command to forward the Prometheus port:

```shell
$ kubectl port-forward -n foxglove service/edge-controller 6002:6002
```

```shell
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:6002/metrics
```

### Slow query logging

Slow query logging in the edge site can be enabled by supplying the following environment variables. Using these should have negligible performance impact.
* `SLOW_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION`: A positive integer indicating the minimum execution time in milliseconds for a query to be considered "slow". Queries slower than this will be written to logs.
* `SLOW_QUERY_LOG_PARAMETERS`: A boolean indicating whether parameters should be logged, defaulting to "false".

These environment variables can be supplied in the "edgeController.env" section of the helm chart.
