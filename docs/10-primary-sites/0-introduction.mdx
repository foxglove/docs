Primary Sites store your robotics data in the cloud, and can be Foxglove- or self-hosted.

### Foxglove-hosted

When you sign up for a Foxglove organization, you are assigned a Foxglove-hosted Primary Site by default. Your organization's data files will be imported to this Primary Site.

### Self-hosted

<AccountRequiredHeader plans={["Enterprise"]} />

Set up a self-hosted Primary Site to store and access robotics data with your own cloud storage solution.

Primary Sites are deployed in your own cloud or on-prem infrastructure to provide highly available storage and access of your data. We currently support Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and self-hosted Kubernetes deployments. Set your cloud accounts up in the data region of your choice, for complete control over your data privacy and security requirements.

To deploy and manage your Primary Site, you must be familiar with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and cloud environments.
