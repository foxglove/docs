The Foxglove Agent runs on your device and monitors its filesystem for recordings. It then notifies Foxglove when they are available for import. These recordings appear on your [Recordings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/recordings) and can be imported on demand.

Follow the [installation instructions](./1-installation.md) to get started.
