The Foxglove Agent runs on a device and monitors a designated directory in its filesystem for newly recorded data files.

Once recordings are available, they appear on your Foxglove organization's [Recordings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/recordings) and can be imported on demand.

[Install the agent](./1-installation.md) on your robots to get started.
