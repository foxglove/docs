Install and configure the Foxglove Agent.

### Prerequisites

- Debian-based Linux distributionÂ (ARM64 and AMD64 architectures supported)
- HTTPS connectivity to `api.foxglove.dev` (stable connection not required)
- The filesystem hosting your recordings storage directory must support `fsnotify`
- Directory for storing local state files
- For self-managed customers, connectivity to your primary site's inbox bucket

### Create a device and device token

Create a device from the [Devices page](https://app.foxglove.dev/~/devices), or select one that you've already created.

An admin for your Foxglove organization can then go to that device's details page, navigate to the "Device Tokens" tab, and generate a secret token. This token will be displayed only once, and is required for agent configuration.

An admin can also create a device token via the Foxglove API. On the [API key settings page](https://app.foxglove.dev/~/settings/apikeys), create an API key with the appropriate `deviceToken` capabilities (list, create, etc), and use it to create device tokens via the [device tokens API endpoint](/api#tag/Device-Tokens).

### Download and upgrade the Foxglove Agent package

Download the latest `foxglove-agent` package for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/foxglove/agent/releases). Install with `dpkg`:

```sh
$ dpkg -i foxglove-agent_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

To upgrade the package, check the releases page for newer release versions to download.

### Configure and run the Foxglove Agent

Configure the `FOXGLOVE_DEVICE_TOKEN` setting in `/etc/foxglove/agent/envfile` with the secret device token generated above. Set additional configuration options, such as your recording directory, according to instructions in that file.

#### Upload to Foxglove-hosted site

By default, your Organization will be configured with a Foxglove-hosted primary site. No additional configuration is required in this case.

#### Upload to self-managed primary site

If your Foxglove organization uses a [self-managed primary site](../10-primary-sites/0-introduction.mdx), your device will need credentials to upload recordings, depending on the cloud service hosting your primary site inbox bucket.

##### GCS

First, install a `credentials.json` file into the device filesystem that authorizes the agent to write into your inbox bucket. The `foxglove` user must have permissions to read this file.

Then, configure the following keys in `/etc/foxglove/agent/envfile`:

```bash
PRIMARY_SITE_MODE=self-managed
INBOX_STORAGE_PROVIDER=google_cloud
# Must be set to a valid bucket name, excluding any `gs://` scheme
INBOX_BUCKET_NAME=...
# Set this to the absolute path of the credentials.json file
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=...
```

##### Azure

Configure the following keys in `/etc/foxglove/agent/envfile`:

```bash
PRIMARY_SITE_MODE=self-managed
INBOX_STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure
# Must be set to a valid bucket name
INBOX_BUCKET_NAME=...
# Set these according to your Azure deployment
AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=...
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
AZURE_INBOX_STORAGE_SERVICE_URL=...
AZURE_INBOX_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=...
```

##### AWS

Configure the following keys in `/etc/foxglove/agent/envfile`:

```bash
PRIMARY_SITE_MODE=self-managed
INBOX_STORAGE_PROVIDER=aws
# Must be set to a valid bucket name
INBOX_BUCKET_NAME=...
# Set these according to your AWS deployment
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=...
```

##### S3-compatible

If your primary site inbox bucket uses a S3-compatible service like [MinIO](https://min.io), configure the following keys in `/etc/foxglove/agent/envfile`:

```bash
PRIMARY_SITE_MODE=self-managed
INBOX_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3_compatible
# Set these according to your S3-compatible service deployment
S3_COMPATIBLE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_COMPATIBLE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
S3_COMPATIBLE_SERVICE_REGION=...
S3_COMPATIBLE_SERVICE_URL=...
```

#### Run the agent

Then, restart the service and check its status with `systemctl`:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl restart foxglove-agent
$ systemctl status foxglove-agent
```

You may want to enable the service to ensure it is started on boot:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable foxglove-agent
```

Consult the logs with `journalctl` for debugging:

```
$ journalctl -u foxglove-agent
```
