> Publish messages on a given topic back to your ROS stack.

## User interactions

Specifying the topic you want to publish your message on will automatically infer its schema name and populate the text field with a JSON message template.

Clicking into the schema name field will provide a dropdown list of common ROS schemas. Selecting a schema will also populate the text field with a JSON message template.

Edit the template to customize the message you want to send back to your ROS stack, before hitting "Publish".

The "Publish" button will be disabled if Studio is not connected to a ROS source.
