title: Panel settings
---

Use the panel settings API to build a settings interface for your extension panels.

The panel settings API allows you to define configurable settings for your extension, and render them in a way that matches Foxglove's appearance – all without having to write any custom UI code.

The `PanelExtensionContext` exposes methods for the business logic of your custom panel – including one to define your settings interface and to configure its values. Check out [`@foxglove/studio`](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/blob/main/packages/studio/index.d.ts) for full type descriptions on all possible configuration values.

## `updatePanelSettingsEditor`

> `updatePanelSettingsEditor: (settings: Readonly<SettingsTree>) => void`

Invoke the `updatePanelSettingsEditor` on your panel's `PanelExtensionContext` instance to define or update its settings.

```typescript
const panelSettings: SettingsTree = {
  nodes: { ... },
  actionHandler: (action: SettingsTreeAction) { ... }
};

context.updatePanelSettingsEditor(panelSettings);
```

### `SettingsTree`

The `settings` argument must be a valid `SettingsTree` and include 2 mandatory properties – `nodes` and `actionHandler`:

- `nodes` - Hierarchical structure where each node can contain input fields, display fields, or even other nodes
- `actionHandler` - Function that is invoked when the user interacts with the settings UI; contains logic to process the interactions and update the panel or settings tree

It can also include the following optional properties:

- `enableFilter` – Whether the settings should show the filter control
- `focusedPath` – Node to scroll to (transient one-time effect)

The example tree below has a `title` text input field inside a `General` section along with an `actionHandler` to respond to updates for the `title` field.

```tsx
const panelSettings: SettingsTree = {
  nodes: {
    general: {
      label: "General",
      fields: {
        title: "{
          label: "Title",
          input: "string",
          // `panelTitle` refers to a value in your extension panel's config
          value: panelTitle,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  actionHandler: (action: SettingsTreeAction) {
    switch (action.action) {
      case "perform-node-action":
        // Handle user-defined actions for nodes in the settings tree
        break;
      case "update":
        if (action.payload.path[0] === "general" && action.payload.path[1] === "title") {
          // Read action.payload.value for the new panel title value
          panelTitle = action.payload.value;

          // Update your panel's state accordingly
        }
        break;
    }
  },
}

context.updatePanelSettingsEditor(panelSettings);
```

### `SettingsTreeAction`

A `SettingsTreeAction` describes how the settings UI should update when a user interacts with its fields.

Each `SettingsTreeAction` has a `payload` with a `path` to the settings field to update (e.g. `["general", "title"]`).

The `update` action corresponds to a user setting a new value for a field (e.g. "My new title").

### Special node properties

There are two special node properties, `label` and `visibility`. The value you specify for `label` will control the label displayed in the settings editor. If you set the `renamable` node property to `true`, the user can edit the node `label` – you will receive a `SettingsTreeAction` of `update` with a path ending in `label`.

In addition, if you specify a boolean value for `visibility` of the node then the settings editor will provide a button to toggle the visibility of the node and you will receive an `update` action with `visibility` as the final element in the path.

For an example of how to use these special properties, check out the [panel settings example extension](https://github.com/foxglove/create-foxglove-extension/tree/main/examples/panel-settings).

### Input types

In addition to the `string` input type in the example above, the panel API provides a wide array of types for your extension panel input fields.

Each input type has different properties that you can configure:

- `autocomplete`
- `boolean`
- `rgb`
- `rgba`
- `gradient`
- `messagepath`
- `select`
- `string`
- `toggle`
- `vec3`
- `vec2`
