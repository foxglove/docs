> Open source software has played a huge role in helping us develop Foxglove Studio, and we're committed to contributing our own software back to the community.

In building Foxglove Studio, we relied heavily on others&apos; open source contributions. That&apos;s why we&apos;re committed to keeping Studio open source and contributing our
own software back to the community.

In addition to Studio, we&apos;ve published several [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) packages to facilitate common development tasks &ndash; like serializing and deserializing data,
parsing message definitions, and exposing helper methods for data manipulation. While these packages were originally developed for Studio, they can be included in any TypeScript or JavaScript project.

Check out our [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/foxglove) and [GitHub](https://github.com/foxglove) pages for more details on all our published packages.
