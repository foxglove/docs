> Use Foxglove libraries to encode and decode data retrieved from Foxglove Data Platform.

Retrieve data from Foxglove Data Platform with clients like [`py-data-platform`](https://github.com/foxglove/py-data-platform), then experiment with that data in a sandbox environment like [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Use the libraries below to encode and decode your fetched data, or to easily read and write MCAP messages.

|            | format   | repo                                                                                        | description                                                           |

|            | ROS 1    | [`python-mcap-ros1-support`](https://github.com/foxglove/python-mcap-ros1-support)          | Read and write ROS 1 messages with the Python MCAP reader / writer    |
|            | ROS 2    | [`foxglove/python-mcap-ros2-support`](https://github.com/foxglove/python-mcap-ros2-support) | Read and write ROS 2 messages with the Python MCAP reader / writer    |
|            | Protobuf | [`python-mcap-protobuf-support`](https://github.com/foxglove/python-mcap-protobuf-support)  | Read and write Protobuf messages with the Python MCAP reader / writer |
