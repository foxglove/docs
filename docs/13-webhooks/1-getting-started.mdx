<AccountRequiredHeader plans={["Team", "Enterprise"]} />

### Prerequisites

To use webhooks, you need:

- An application that exposes an HTTPS endpoint on the public internet – If your application runs inside a VPN, you can use a webhook proxy or HTTPS proxy to forward notifications to your internal application
- Admin access to a Foxglove organization on the Enterprise plan

### Create a new webhook

Log in to [Foxglove](https://console.foxglove.dev), and navigate to the [Webhooks settings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/webhooks/).

To add a new webhook:

- Give it a unique name
- Fill in your public API endpoint URL under _URL_
- Select at least one event type to subscribe to

After creating the webhook, you can use the generated secret token to verify the sender of notifications.

### Test with a `ping` event

Click your newly created webhook on the [Webbhooks settings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/webhooks/), and trigger a `ping` event to test its connectivity.

Your application should receive a POST request body similar to the one below:

```
{
  "timestamp": "2022-10-01T06:54:29.078Z",
  "deliveryAttemptedAt": "2022-10-01T06:54:31.021Z",
  "eventId": "whev_uDYJSMFeVF2y5ZfL",
  "webhookId": "whk_KS6UE8rZfJ5CrBSY",
  "type": "ping",
  "webhook": {
    "id": "whk_KS6UE8rZfJ5CrBSY"
  }
}
```

Refreshing the page in your browser should also show a _Delivery_ entry with a `200` status code at the top of the page. If your delivery was unsuccessful, it should still show up as an entry – click through to see details like its failure time, response status, and error message.

### Retry a failed delivery

Manually retry a failed delivery by clicking `Retry` from the failed delivery details page.
