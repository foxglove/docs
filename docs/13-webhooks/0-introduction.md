Webhooks notify your software when events happen within your Foxglove organization.

When you create a webhook, notifications about events are delivered to your webhook endpoint. Notifications are delivered as HTTPS POST requests with a JSON body. Check the [Concepts](./1-concepts.md) page for more details on these terms.

In the [Settings](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/webhooks/) page for your webhook you can view a history of recent deliveries, and see failure details for deliveries that fail.

[Set up a Webhook](./2-get-started.md) to get started.
