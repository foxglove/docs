> Create and sign in to your Foxglove account to access your team's data – from shared layouts to imported robot data.

You must create a Foxglove account to store and manage your team's robotics data in [Foxglove Data Platform](/data-platform).

A Foxglove account also gives you access to several unique [Foxglove Studio](/studio) features:

- Save your Studio layouts to a remote store, to sync them across multiple devices
- Share and collaborate on layouts with other members of your organization

## Web console

Go to [console.foxglove.dev](https://console.foxglove.dev/) to get started.

When you sign up for a Foxglove account for the first time, you will be prompted to create or join an organization.

Foxglove Data Platform offers several ways to tag and manage your data:

- **[Events](/docs/data-platform/tagging-data/events)** – Identify points of interest in a data recording
- **[MCAP metadata records](/docs/data-platform/importing-data#import-data)** – Store contextual information about a data recording on import (e.g. robot ID, hardware details, operating location)
- **[MCAP attachments](/docs/data-platform/importing-data#import-data)** – Store auxiliary artifacts for a data recording on import (e.g. maps, calibration values, system log files)
- **Custom properties** – Store contextual information about a Foxglove Data Platform resource (e.g. devices, recordings, etc.)
