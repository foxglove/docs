> Admins for a Foxglove organization can use the Insights dashboard to understand how their members are using Data Platform.

If you’re using Foxglove Data Platform to store, organize, and annotate robotics data, you may be curious about how exactly your team or company is leveraging the tool.

The Insights dashboard helps Foxglove organization administrators answer these questions. It can determine how your team currently uses Foxglove, and how you can optimize your team’s usage to reach your full potential.

## Viewing the dashboard

Once logged in to [your Foxglove account](https://console.foxglove.dev), navigate to the [_Settings_ page](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/insights).

Here, you'll see the following charts:

- [Import volume](#import-volume)
- [Occurring events](#occurring-events)

### Import volume

The _Import volume_ chart tracks the amount of data (net and cumulative) your Foxglove organization members have imported, by week:

Tracking your import volume can give you a sense of the data storage your company will be billed for, whether you are nearing your plan’s data limit, and the periods of time when your team imported the most data.

### Occurring events

The _Occurring events_ chart tracks the number of events added for a given week of collected data, by week:

Getting a sense of the date ranges that your team has annotated the most can not only give you a sense of your data coverage, but also whether your team is taking full advantage of this powerful strategy for organizing and exploring your data.
