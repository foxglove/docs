> **This feature requires an Enterprise plan.**

Foxglove Edge Sites are on-site data centers, located in physical proximity to where your robots are operating. They are designed to safely store data on-premises before you decide to forward it to the cloud, thus mitigating the risks of unpredictable network connectivity or low bandwidth. Whether your robots operate in a warehouse, farm field, or garage, Edge Sites help you pull your data on-demand from these resource-constrained environments for further analysis.

You can create and name any number of Edge Sites via your Foxglove web console to get visibility into what data is at the edge, and whether that data has been [queued for import](manage-data#import-to-primary) to your Primary Site in the cloud. Each created Edge Site must belong to and send data to a Primary Site.

Familiarity with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is required to deploy and manage your Edge Site.
