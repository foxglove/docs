Foxglove Studio can load and inspect [MCAP](https://mcap.dev) (`.mcap`) files stored locally on your computer and remotely in cloud storage.

## Files

Open MCAP (`.mcap`) files from your local filesystem or a remote cloud storage solution.

### Local file

To load a local MCAP (`.mcap`) file, double-click it from your file manager, drag-and-drop the file directly into the app, or _Open local file_ via the _Data source_ dialog:

### Cloud data

#### Foxglove Data Platform

Use [Foxglove Data Platform](/data-platform)'s [web console](https://console.foxglove.dev) to upload your MCAP (`.mcap`) files and stream it directly into Foxglove Studio.

Check out the [Data Platform docs](/docs/data-platform/exporting-and-visualizing-data) for more information on how to export and visualize your robotics data.

#### By URL

To load a remote MCAP (`.mcap`) file, select _Open file from URL_ in the _Data source_ dialog, and enter the URL to your remote file:
