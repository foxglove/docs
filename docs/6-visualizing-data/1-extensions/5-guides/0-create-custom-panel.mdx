This guide takes you through making a custom panel extension. You'll learn how to setup your extension project, build a basic panel to subscribe to a topic, and register the panel so it can be added to the layout.

## Setting up

In a Terminal window, `cd` into the directory where your source code will live and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm init foxglove-extension@latest myExtensionName
```

This uses [`create-foxglove-extension`](https://github.com/foxglove/create-foxglove-extension) to create a `myExtensionName` directory containing source code for an example custom panel.

### `index.ts`

**`index.ts` is the entry point for your extension source code.**

It must export an `activate` function that:

- **Accepts an `extensionContext` argument** - For more info on the `ExtensionContext` type, see [`@foxglove/studio`](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/blob/main/packages/studio/index.d.ts)

- **Registers your extension's panels** - i.e. `ExamplePanel`, in this case

  ```ts
  export function activate(extensionContext: ExtensionContext) {
    extensionContext.registerPanel({ name: "example-panel", initPanel: initExamplePanel });
  }
  ```

### `ExamplePanel.tsx`

**The panel file(s) referenced in `index.ts` define the behavior and UI of the custom panel(s) that your extension will install.**

While `ExamplePanel.tsx` is written in React, panels are framework agnostic - i.e. they can be written using DOM primitives, React, or any other front-end framework. Check out the [turtlesim extension](https://github.com/foxglove/studio-extension-turtlesim/blob/main/src/TurtlePanel.ts) for an example panel written without React.

The `initPanel` function accepts a `PanelExtensionContext` argument, which contains properties and methods for accessing panel data and rendering UI updates. It also returns an optional cleanup function to run when the extension `panelElement` unmounts.

### `PanelExtensionContext`

See the [`PanelExtensionContext`](/docs/studio/extensions/panel-api) docs for available properties and methods.
