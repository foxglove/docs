## Installation

To build and install your extension into a local Studio extensions folder, run `npm run local-install`. This will create a folder under your home directory (e.g. `~/.foxglove-studio/extensions/unknown.myExtensionName-0.0.0`) with your compiled extension.

Open the latest version of Studio. You should now see `myExtensionName` in the list of installed extensions in your [app settings](/docs/studio/app-concepts/preferences#extensions).

Once installed, you should be able to open the _Add panel_ menu and see an option called `ExamplePanel`. You've successfully loaded your first Studio extension!

Alternatively, if you've already [published](/docs/studio/extensions/publish) your extension, you can also just double-click on the produced `.foxe` file to install your extension in Studio.

## Development

Each time you make a change to your extension, you must run `npm run local-install` to build it to your local extensions folder.

You must then reload or restart Studio to execute the latest version of your extension code in the app. Alternatively, you can confirm your code compiles without installing it locally by simply running `npm run build`.
