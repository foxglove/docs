While creating a Foxglove account is not necessary to use [Foxglove Studio](/studio), signing in does allow you to access several unique features:

- Save your Studio layouts to a remote store, to sync them across multiple devices
- Share and collaborate on layouts with other members of your organization
- Store and manage your team's robotics data using [Foxglove Data Platform](/data-platform)

## Getting started

Sign up at [https://console.foxglove.dev/signup](https://console.foxglove.dev/signup). When you sign up for the first time, you must create or join an organization, even as a solo user.

Once signed in, you will have access to your dashboard, where you'll be able to manage your organization's members, view your team layouts, and manage your shared data.
