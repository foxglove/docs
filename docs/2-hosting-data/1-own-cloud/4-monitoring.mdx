## Prometheus
The primary site services expose processing and memory metrics on a
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics scraping endpoint called "metrics"
on port 6001.

Integration will depend on the specifics of your Kubernetes setup. For more information see,
* GCP: [Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus)
* AWS: [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/)
* Azure: [Azure Monitor Managed Service for Prometheus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)

for integrating these metrics with the metrics platform of your cloud provider.
