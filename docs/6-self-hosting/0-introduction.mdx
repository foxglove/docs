To store and access robotics data with your own cloud storage solution, you can set up a self-managed Primary Site.

Primary Sites are deployed in your own cloud infrastructure to provide highly available storage and access of your data. We currently support Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Azure. Set your cloud accounts up in the data region of your choice, for complete control over your data privacy and security requirements.

To deploy and manage your Primary Site, you must be familiar with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and cloud environments.
