## Prometheus

The Primary Site services expose processing and memory metrics on a
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics scraping endpoint called "metrics"
on port 6001.

Integrate these metrics with the metrics platform of your cloud provider. This will depend on the specifics of your Kubernetes setup:

- GCP: [Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus)
- AWS: [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/)
- Azure: [Azure Monitor Managed Service for Prometheus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)
