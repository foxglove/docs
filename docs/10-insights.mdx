Admins can use the Insights dashboard to understand how their members are using Foxglove.

If you’re using Foxglove to store, organize, and annotate robotics data, you may be curious about how exactly your team or company is leveraging the tool.

The Insights dashboard helps Foxglove organization administrators answer these questions. It can determine how your team currently uses Foxglove, and how you can optimize your team’s usage to reach your full potential.

## Dashboard

Once logged in to your [Foxglove account](https://console.foxglove.dev), navigate to the [Insights settings page](https://console.foxglove.dev/settings/insights).

This can give admins a sense of your company's data storage bill, whether you are nearing your plan’s data limit, and the time periods during which the team imported the most data.

### Occurring events

Track the number of events added for a given week of collected data, by week:

This can give you a sense of your data coverage, as well as whether your team is taking full advantage of this data organization and exploration strategy.
