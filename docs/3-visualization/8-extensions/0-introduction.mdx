Extend Foxglove's capabilities with custom extensions to better support your team's unique workflows. Build bespoke panels, convert custom messages to Foxglove-supported schemas, and alias topic names for easy visualization.

Once you've developed and installed your extension, you can open your [app settings](/docs/visualization/introduction#settings#extensions) to display all available and installed extensions.

### Custom panels

While Foxglove offers a suite of built-in panels for robotics data visualization and debugging, many users have domain-specific needs that our out-of-the-box offering does not address.

Custom panel extensions allow you to build an entire panel. Custom panels can subscribe to messages on various topics, advertise and publish, and display the message information in whatever form is most relevant for your workflow.

Custom panels are ideal when your visualization or interaction needs are bespoke and not easily solved via one of the built-in panels.

### Message converters

Message converter extensions allow you to convert messages from one schema to another. By transforming your custom messages to adhere to a Foxglove-supported schema, you can inspect them using Foxglove's built-in visualization features.

For example, an extension could convert your custom GPS message into a [`foxglove.LocationFix`](/docs/visualization/message-schemas/location-fix) message to be displayed within the [Map panel](/docs/visualization/panels/map).

### Topic aliases

Topic alias extensions allow you to alias topics in your data source to new topics. Foxglove panels can subscribe to both the aliased topics and the original data source's topics.

## Writing an extension

You can write extensions in JavaScript or Typescript and package them into `.foxe` files. You can distribute these files privately to your Foxglove organization or publicly via our [marketplace](https://github.com/foxglove/studio-extension-marketplace). A single extension can include multiple panels or converters.

Foxglove provides a set of starter templates and commands in the [`create-foxglove-extension`](https://github.com/foxglove/create-foxglove-extension) package to simplify authoring an extension.

Requirements:

- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/)

To set up your extension project, navigate to the directory where you'll want your source code to live and run the following command in a Terminal window:

```bash
$ npm init foxglove-extension@latest my-extension-name
```

This will set up an extension directory structure. The entrypoint of your extension is the `index.ts` file.

The entrypoint script MUST export a single `activate` function which accepts a single `ExtensionContext` argument.

### Custom panels

```typescript
export function activate(extensionContext: ExtensionContext) {
  // your extension code will decide which methods to call on the extensionContext
  // Here's an example which registers a new panel:
  extensionContext.registerPanel({ name: "example-panel", initPanel: initExamplePanel });
}
```

### Message converters

```typescript
export function activate(extensionContext: ExtensionContext) {
  // Register a new message converter:
  extensionContext.registerMessageConverter({
    fromSchemaName: "sensors.MyGps",
    toSchemaName: "foxglove.LocationFix",
    converter: (inputMessage) => {
      // logic to turn sensors.MyGps messages into foxglove.LocationFix messages
    },
  });
}
```

### Topic aliases

The `registerTopicAliases` function accepts two arguments – the data source's original topics and the current layout's global variables – and outputs a list of aliased topics:

```typescript
import { ExtensionContext } from "@foxglove/studio";

export function activate(extensionContext: ExtensionContext): void {
  // Register a topic alias function that takes the current list of datasource topics and
  // global variables and outputs a list of topic aliases.
  extensionContext.registerTopicAliases((args) => {
    const { globalVariables } = args;
    // Output a list of aliased topics, in this case influenced by the current value of
    // the global variable `camera`.
    const camera = globalVariables["camera"] ?? "FRONT";
    return [
      { sourceTopicName: `/CAM_${camera}/image_rect_compressed`, name: `/selected_camera_image` },
      { sourceTopicName: "/imu", name: "/aliased_imu" },
      { sourceTopicName: "/odom", name: "/aliased_odom" },
    ];
  });
}

```

This `registerTopicAliases` function is rerun whenever the data source's original topics or the current layout's global variables change.
