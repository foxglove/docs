The `activate` function's first argument is an `ExtensionContext` – this context allows you to extend Foxglove for your custom workflows.

```typescript
export function activate(extensionContext: ExtensionContext) {
  // ... call methods on the extensionContext to extend Foxglove
}
```

## registerPanel

`registerPanel` adds a new panel to the Foxglove panel catalog. To register a panel you provide a `name` and an `initPanel` function.

The `initPanel` function accepts a `PanelExtensionContext` argument, which contains properties and methods for accessing panel data and rendering UI updates. It also returns an optional cleanup function to run when the extension `panelElement` unmounts.

See the [Creating a custom panel](../guides/create-custom-panel) guide for more details.

## registerMessageConverter

`registerMessageConverter` register a function to convert messages from one schema to another.

Message converters allow you to leverage the visualization features of built-in Foxglove panels for your own custom messages by writing a conversion from your custom message to a set of well-known messages supported within the panels — for example, by converting your own GPS messages to `foxglove.LocationFix` for visualization in the Map panel.

The converter function is invoked when a panel subscribes to a topic with the `convertTo` option indicating it would like to run the converter on the original message. The return value of the converter function is the converted message and is provided to the panel.

If the converter function invocation returns `undefined`, the output of the converter for that message is ignored and no message is provided to the panel. This is useful in instances where you might want to selectively output a converted schema depending on the input message.

See the [Creating a message converter](../guides/create-message-converter) guide for more details.
