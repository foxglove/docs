Events represent points or time ranges of interest in your organization's recordings. They help you quickly identify, categorize, and search for relevant subsets of your data.

Each event requires an associated device, timestamp, and duration (0 for an instantaneous event). It can also contain optional metadata.

### Actions

Create, list, delete, and search events from the [Events page](https://console.foxglove.dev/events).

|            | Definition                                                    | CLI                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Create** | Create an event to flag interesting data in your organization | `TBD`                  |
| **List**   | View your organization's events                               | `foxglove events list` |
| **Delete** | Delete an event in your organization                          | `TBD`                  |


### Search

Search events by device, time range, and metadata on the [Events page](https://console.foxglove.dev/events).

Use the syntax below to filter by metadata keys and values:

|                                | Specific key                      | Any key  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Specific value                 | `weather:rain`                    | `*:rain` |
| Any value                      | `weather:*`                       |          |
| Multiple values (all required) | `weather:rain weather:fog`        |          |
| Multiple values (1+ required)  | `weather:rain,fog,"mostly sunny"` |          |

A single word (e.g. `error`) will look for matching metadata keys or values.
