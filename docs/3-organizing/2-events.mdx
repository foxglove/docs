Events represent points or time ranges of interest in your organization's recordings. They help you quickly identify, categorize, and search for relevant subsets of your data.

### Create

Create an event to flag points or time ranges of interest in your organization's data.

Each event requires an associated device, timestamp, and duration (0 for an instantaneous event). It can also contain optional metadata.

| CLI    | `$ foxglove events list`                                     |

### Search

Search events by device, time range, and metadata.

The metadata field uses specific syntax to filter events:

- `weather:rain` – Find events with a certain metadata key and corresponding value
- `weather:*` – Find events with a certain metadata key and any value
- `*:rain` – Find events with a certain metadata value and any key
- `weather:rain weather:fog` – Find events with `weather` that matches both `rain` AND `fog`
- `weather:rain,fog,"mostly sunny"` – Find events with `weather` that matches `rain` OR `fog` OR `"mostly sunny"` (double quotes used for values with spaces)
- `error` – Find events with either a key or value tagged “error”
