We've implemented two customer-requested tickets that we're excited to see out in the wild â€“ more powerful topic name and message field searching, and the ability to load 3D models in the 3D panel's scene.

**Added**

- Added ability to search for both topics and message fields in the message path input behind an Experimental Feature flag ( `Include fields names in message path search`)
- Added panel setting to sync and unsync Plot panels with timestamp-based x-axes with others in the layout
- Added support for displaying `int64` and `uint64` values in the Plot and State Transitions panels
- Added support for loading glTF (.glb) files via a marker's `mesh_resource` field in the 3D panel

**Changed**

- Changed appearance of floating toolbars in the 3D and Topic Graph panels due to Fluent UI refactor

**Fixed**

- Fixed bug where the app would sometimes crash on Windows due to font loading issues
