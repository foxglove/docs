We've implemented two customer-requested tickets that we're excited to see out in the wild – more powerful topic name and message field searching, and the ability to load 3D models in the 3D panel's scene.

**Added**

- Added ability to search for both topics and message fields in the message path input behind an Experimental Feature flag ( `Include fields names in message path search`) ([#1971](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1971))
- Added panel setting to sync and unsync Plot panels with timestamp-based x-axes with others in the layout ([#1976](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1976))
- Added support for displaying `int64` and `uint64` values in the Plot and State Transitions panels ([#1979](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1979))
- Added support for loading glTF (.glb) files via a marker's `mesh_resource` field in the 3D panel ([#1983](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1983))

**Changed**
- Changed appearance of floating toolbars in the 3D and Topic Graph panels due to Fluent UI refactor ([#1974](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1974))

**Fixed**
- Fixed bug where the app would sometimes crash on Windows due to font loading issues ([#1994](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1994))
