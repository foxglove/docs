The latest iteration of our 3D Panel is available for beta testing! ðŸ¥³

Add the new `3D (Beta)` panel to your layout, and check out its newly streamlined settings UI in the sidebar's "Panel settings" tab. Enjoy a more seamless visualization and debugging experience, with improved 3D rendering performance and other upgrades. 

**Added**
- Enabled custom panel extensions in the Foxglove Studio web app
- Added a new `3D (Beta)` panel, designed largely to improve 3D rendering performance, for user testing
- Added ability to filter by label in the sidebarâ€™s panel settings UI 
* [Extension API] Added aÂ `dataSourceProfile`Â string toÂ the `PanelExtensionContext`

**Changed**
- Made Data source dialog more responsive on smaller screens

**Fixed**
- Fixed the sample data layout so that clicking the `Diagnostics â€“ Summary (ROS)` panel correctly updates the existing `Diagnostics â€“ Details (ROS)` panel 
- Fixed an issue where the app would temporarily stop displaying data when panels were hidden or removed from the layout 
- Fixed an issue with the Plot panelâ€™s legend not having an updated list of paths whenever a path is added from outside the panel, e.g. a Raw Messages panel 
- Fixed issues with native ROS 2 connections by including missing datatypes in the underlying data player
