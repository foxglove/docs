Happy new year! Check out our much improved sample data - we think it better demonstrates the power of Foxglove.

**Added**

- Added [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) sample data and layout
- Added support for changing playback speed for Foxglove data
- Added support for multiple Foxglove processes in native ROS 1 and 2 data sources

**Changed**

- Improved ROS 1 error handling
- Made performance improvements when loading remote files
- Prevented zooming below a threshold in Image Panel to avoid getting "lost in space"
- Changed Plot panel tooltips to only show a single value + overflow message
- Avoided deselecting a panel on second click when the settings are open
- Made reselecting the same panel type a no-op
- Rendered small points as rectangles in the Image panel for better performance
- Removed zoom in instructions from the Plot panel tooltip's overflow message
- Improved error message when failing to load mesh markers

**Fixed**

- Fixed the Data source dialog's height
- Queued ROS 1 advertise requests until ROS 1 node is ready
- Fixed follow mode in orthographic mode so the camera no longer wobbles
- Fixed setting publishers before getting topics in the ROS 1 player
- Fixed rendering mesh resource markers referencing ASCII STL files in the 3D panel
- Fixed `rosbag` initialization errors not showing to the user
- Fixed Image panel from flickering during zoom
- Fixed `PointCloud2`s' `rgb` and `rgba` fields when `is_bigendian = false`
- Fixed the Data source dialog's recent connections list for new users
- Fixed transform loading from URDF robot models in the 3D panel
