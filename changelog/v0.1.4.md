Happy Monday! Here are some new features and tweaks for your enjoyment...

#### Added
- Windows builds are now available! Try them out and send us your feedback.
- Added file association support (double click to open `.bag` files in Foxglove) ([#213](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/213))

#### Changed
- Improved Experimental Features dialog ([#234](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/234))
- UX improvements to showing/hiding menus ([#213](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/213))

#### Removed
- Removed vim support in Node Playground editor ([#250](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/250))

#### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect rendering of special characters ([#214](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/214))

We've also been hard at work refactoring things and speeding up our internal development workflow. View the [full list of commits](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/compare/v0.1.2...v0.1.4) in this release for details.

**Note:** `v0.1.3` was removed, as it contained a bug loading bag files. This has now been fixed ([#266](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/266)). Sorry for the interruption!

**macOS users:** Please download the `dmg` file to install Foxglove Studio, not the `zip` file. The `zip` file should only be used by our auto-updater. Please also be sure to download the correct architecture (`mac` for Intel-based macs, `mac-arm64` for newer M1 macs) - universal binaries are coming [ðŸ”œ](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/269).
