**Added**
- Introduced a setting for the Plot panel to toggle lines between data points

**Changed**
- Moved the Plot panel’s “Download as CSV” feature from the toolbar to a context menu
- FlatBuffer messages will now appear with all schema-specified default values populated, even if they were not serialized explicitly in the binary data

**Fixed**
- Fixed the `google.protobuf.Duration` and `google.protobuf.Timestamp` generated type definitions in the User Scripts panel, so they match the way timestamps are represented in the rest of the app (i.e. `{sec, nsec}`, not `{seconds, nanos}`)
- Fixed the precision of number input fields in the panel settings
