**Fixed**
- Fixed an issue with color pickers in panel settings not updating panels
- Fixed message coloring in the Diagnostics – Detail (ROS) panel
- Fixed resubscribing to topics when a Foxglove WebSocket connection is broken and reestablished
- Fixed an extraneous warning shown for some Foxglove WebSocket connection
- Fixed an issue with RGBA coloring of Grid messages in the 3D panel where fully transparent pixels were not displayed as transparent
- Colors for `foxglove.PointCloud` and `foxglove.Grid` messages are now clamped to minimum and maximum values, rather than displaying incorrect colors when values lie outside the selected range
