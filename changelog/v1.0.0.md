We made it - Foxglove Studio is officially 1.0! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‚ðŸš€ 

With this release, we also announced [MCAP](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap), a new file format designed specifically for robotics use cases. Foxglove Studio now supports loading MCAP files for visualizing and debugging your recorded data.

[Read our full announcement](https://foxglove.dev/blog/introducing-the-mcap-file-format) to learn more about why we were motivated to design MCAP, and how this standardized container format can help you better record and understand your robotics data.

**Added**

- Added support for loading local [MCAP](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap) files
- Added a newÂ `./types`Â utility file to the Node Playground panel
- Added support for `$(arg)` substitution and `<xacro:arg>` defaults for URDF (`.urdf.xacro`) files
- Added support for alpha rendering of `rgba` fields in `PointCloud2` messages; changed interpretation of `rgb`/`rgba` fields to use RGBA byte order by default
- Added a legend position setting to the Plot panel
- Added an option to make convex hulls of polygon markers clickable in the 3D panel
- Added support for viewing `foxglove.Log` messages in the Log panel
- Added a context menu with all possible markers to select when clicking overlapping markers in the 3D panel

**Changed**

- Changed the Raw Messages panel to remember fields' expansion states after playback loops
- Added a warning when a Rosbridge connection is taking too long to look up topics and message definitions
- Added better error messages when URDF files fail to load via drag-and-drop
- Improved rendering and removed the line width setting for grids in the 3D panel
- Changed the panel list to highlight the first entry only when typing a search term
- Ensured that newly added panels that subscribe to an infrequently publishing topic (i.e. `/tf_static`) receive the appropriate messages
- Ensured users never land in a state with no layout
- Ensured the player keeps the current time when opening a Foxglove Data Platform deep link, even if the originally requested start and end time have to be clamped to a different valid range

**Fixed**
- Fixed the app menu option to correctly open a Rosbridge connection
- Fixed the panel settings editor to correctly read the default config values
- Fixed an app crash in the 3D panel by displaying an error instead when fields are missing from a `PointCloud2` topic's message
- Fixed a bug that prevented tooltips from being shown on newly selected message paths in the Plot panel
- Fixed an error that appeared when using the Node Playground panel in multiple tabs or windows at the same time
- Fixed the Raw Messages panel to more reliably show latching topics' latest messages on startup
- Fixed a memory leak that occurs when the app receives many out-of-order messages due to the presence of theÂ `/clock`Â topic
- Fixed a `Data went back in time` warning that appeared in certain cases when using `/clock` with Rosbridge connections
- Fixed an issue where the Plot panel's legend would be incorrectly formatted when the user hovers on a point without a valid current value and when the `Show plot values in legend` setting is toggled on
- Fixed a bug where adding a new series would clear data from the current series in the Plot panel
- Fixed an issue where the Plot and State Transitions panels incorrectly interpreted a pan gesture as a click to seek
