- Enabled the Image panel's image markers dropdown, even when their topic name does not match the camera image topic ([#1584](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1584))
- Scoped app styling to a top-level app container, instead of applying styles globally ([#1590](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1590))

**Fixed**
