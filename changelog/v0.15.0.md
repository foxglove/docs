In this release, we focused on bug fixes and making further improvements to app styling.

**Changed**

- Enabled the Image panel's image markers dropdown, even when their topic name does not match the camera image topic
- Scoped app styling to a top-level app container, instead of applying styles globally

**Fixed**

- Fixed the Image panel's download feature to download the image at its original size
- Fixed a crash when hovering on `int64` or `uint64` values inside arrays in the Raw Messages panel
- Fixed a memory leak when attempting to automatically re-establish a connection to a `rosbridge` WebSocket
- Fixed 3D panel error that appears when turning a topic off after toggling its namespace markers
- Removed outdated Slack channel from Node Playground panel documentation

**Internals**

- Removed references to global `React` in the `ErrorBoundary` component 
- Added back the legacy 2D Plot panel under a feature flag
- Deleted unused code from the `@foxglove/studio-base` package
- Upgraded dependencies, including `@foxglove/rosbag`
- Updated lint rules to ban the use of the `any` type in conditionals
