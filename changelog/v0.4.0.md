Our robots have been hard at work attempting to press buttons on keyboards, and it appears to have resulted in new features.

#### Added

- We can now render raw Velodyne point clouds (`velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan` messages from `/velodyne_packets` topic) in Foxglove Studio, without them needing to be converted into `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`. This makes it possible to visualize point clouds from additional open source datasets such as the [Udacity Self Driving Car](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets) dataset. ([#411](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/411))
- Support for unpublished transforms referenced in point clouds ([#442](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/442)), and transforms with missing parents ([#474](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/474))
- Support for all `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` field data types ([#440](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/440))
- Support for older style `tf/tfMessage` transforms ([#444](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/444))
- Added a "repeat" toggle to enable/disable repeat during bag playback ([#381](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/381))
- Added new `telemetry.crashReportingEnabled` preference ([#469](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/469))

#### Changed

- Automatic x-axis sync in Plot and State Transition panels ([#341](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/341))
- Integrated `@fluentui/react` component library, with some minor icon other UI changes ([#457](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/457))
- Auto-hide menu bar on Linux and Windows ([#436](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/436))
- Remember last URL for ROS and bag connections ([#463](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/463))

#### Fixed

- Fixed several issues with Node Playground ([#445](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/445))
- Fixed native file system integration (double click to open bag) ([#419](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/419))
- Fixed errors attempting to publish to empty topics ([#412](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/412))
- Fixed support for bags with unaligned `Float32Array` ([#471](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/471))
- Minor improvements to how we handle some errors ([#404](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/404))
- Cleaned up menu warnings in the developer console ([#409](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/409))

#### Internals

- New `@foxglove/velodyne-cloud` package for working with raw Velodyne packets in TypeScript ([#350](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/350))
- New `@foxglove/log` package ([#416](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/416))
- Upgraded `chart.js` to v3, moved off a custom fork, and rewrote most of the Plot and State Transitions panels in the process ([#341](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/341))
- Upgraded `react-mosaic-component` and moved off a custom fork ([#410](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/410))
- Replaced `react-spring` with `react-transition-group` ([#433](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/433))
