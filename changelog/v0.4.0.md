Our robots have been hard at work attempting to press buttons on keyboards, and it appears to have resulted in new features.

#### Added

- We can now render raw Velodyne point clouds (`velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan` messages from `/velodyne_packets` topic) in Foxglove, without them needing to be converted into `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`. This makes it possible to visualize point clouds from additional open source datasets such as the [Udacity Self Driving Car](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets) dataset.
- Support for unpublished transforms referenced in point clouds, and transforms with missing parents
- Support for all `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` field data types
- Support for older style `tf/tfMessage` transforms
- Added a "repeat" toggle to enable/disable repeat during bag playback
- Added new `telemetry.crashReportingEnabled` preference

#### Changed

- Automatic x-axis sync in Plot and State Transition panels
- Integrated `@fluentui/react` component library, with some minor icon other UI changes
- Auto-hide menu bar on Linux and Windows
- Remember last URL for ROS and bag connections

#### Fixed

- Fixed several issues with Node Playground
- Fixed native file system integration (double click to open bag)
- Fixed errors attempting to publish to empty topics
- Fixed support for bags with unaligned `Float32Array`
- Minor improvements to how we handle some errors
- Cleaned up menu warnings in the developer console

#### Internals

- New `@foxglove/velodyne-cloud` package for working with raw Velodyne packets in TypeScript
- New `@foxglove/log` package
- Upgraded `chart.js` to v3, moved off a custom fork, and rewrote most of the Plot and State Transitions panels in the process
- Upgraded `react-mosaic-component` and moved off a custom fork
- Replaced `react-spring` with `react-transition-group`
