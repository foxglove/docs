## Smoother navigation

- You can now visualize your data and manage your Devices, Recordings, and Events all in the same app. This new workflow is available both in the desktop app and at https://app.foxglove.dev/. Click the Foxglove logo to access the new navigation from the visualization screen:

- When opening the app, you will now be greeted with the Dashboard. The “Open local file”, “Open connection”, “Recently viewed”, and “Explore sample data” features are now part of the Dashboard.

## Performance improvements

- We’ve made performance improvements across plots, user scripts, 3D models, H.264 video, and general playback.
- Fixed an issue where Windows 11 would put the app into “efficiency mode”, degrading app performance.

## More panel actions

- The panel actions overlay now has separate buttons to split right and split down, rather than a single split button that chooses a split direction automatically. Hold the backtick (`` ` ``) key and hover over a panel to access the quick actions:

## Playback and data sources

- The playback speed setting is no longer saved per-layout; instead, the setting will persist for an individual user/browser.
- Topics using OMG IDL schemas now support optional member fields on mutable structs.
- Fixed an issue with loading glTF models via `package://` URLs over a WebSocket connection.
- The “Message rate” setting has been removed. Adjusting this setting did not always have the intended effect, and the application already adapts dynamically to system performance.

## Plots

- The Plot panel now displays more information about series errors and warnings in the legend.

- Fixed some visual alignment issues in Plot and State Transitions.

## 3D

- Fixed an issue in the 3D panel where the scene would not exactly track the mouse while panning in 2D mode.

## Log

- The Log panel now supports Message Converters with a `toSchemaName` that matches one of the panel’s supported schemas.

## Extensions

- Fixed a bug that caused a message converters to be run on `allFrames` when they should not have been.
