**Added**

- Added links for contacting Foxglove and scheduling a demo to the Data source dialog
- Added basic support for `foxglove.Grid`, `foxglove.PointCloud`, and `foxglove.LaserScan` messages to the 3D and Node Playground panels, for users with MCAP files or Foxglove WebSocket data sources

**Changed**

- Allow users to set `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` to the root of their workspace so Foxglove can traverse all subdirectories when resolving `package://` urls

**Fixed**

- Fixed a jumping dropdown menu in the Diagnostic panels
- Fixed publishing to `roscpp` subscribers
