We've added a new and improved Image panel that supports overlaying 3D markers on 2D images. The old "Image (Legacy)" panel is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

**Added**

- Added the new Image panel

**Changed**

- Improved performance of the Plot panel on large datasets
- Improved error messages in the User Scripts panel for unsupported types
- Revised the panel extension API to allow passing a Time object, instead of a number, as an argument to the seekPlayback function
- Improved the User Scripts panel's recovery from input topic errors

**Fixed**

- Fixed an issue where built-in ROS datatypes were overwriting the data sourceâ€™s included datatypes
- Fixed `LinePrimitive` rendering and selection issues in the 3D panel
- Fixed CDR serialization/deserialization of empty messages
- Fixed a bug with dynamic resizing of autocomplete options in the settings sidebar
- Fixed an issue where toggling the Plot panel legend opens the settings sidebar
- Fixed an issue with seeking precision in the Map panel
- Fixed message processing order in the User Scripts panel
