We've reorganized our repo for optimized web and desktop builds, migrated our Redux store to React contexts, and addressed miscellaneous bug fixes and feature requests.

**Added**
- Duplicate a layout in the Layouts menu
- Display the appropriate dev mode app icon on Windows
- Reduce bundle size by only supporting JSON (vs. JSON and YAML) for the 3D panel's camera info and polygon editing feature

**Fixed**
- Align Connection menu items
- Fix the 3D panel's ability to save CameraInfo
- Support all known datatype prefixes (i.e. `visualization_msgs/`, `webviz_msgs/`, `foxglove_msgs/`, and `studio_msgs/`) for `ImageMarkerArray`
- Support consistent header stamp extraction across the app, including for `ImageMarkerArray`
- Fixed the Plot panel's chart component from going blank after user interactions, like resizing or clicking

**Internals**
- Minify production builds to reduce CI integration test run time
- Update `roslibjs`, Typescript, and `wasm-lz4`
- Update linting rules, and fix resulting warnings
- Removed unused internal debugging panels: Number of Renders, Subscribe to List
- Remove Redux after moving all relevant state to React contexts
- Reorganized app code and Foxglove packages as top-level folders in the `packages/` directory
