**Added**
- Added a [Spotlight plugin](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/MDImporters/MDImporters.html) for [MCAP](https://mcap.dev/) files to the macOS desktop app, allowing MCAP files' topics, schemas, attachments, and metadata to be searchable via Finder and Spotlight ([#4745](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4745))

**Changed**
- Made deprecation banner for the 3D (Legacy) panel impossible to dismiss ([#4756](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4756)) 
- Replaced the packed "RGB"/"RGBA" color modes with a new “RGBA (separate fields)” mode for `foxglove.PointCloud` and `foxglove.Grid` topics in the 3D panel ([#4762](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4762))
- Removed the "RGB Byte Order" setting for ROS `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` topics in the 3D panel, and made the byte order compatible with RViz; renamed the color modes to “BGR”/“BGRA” to accurately reflect the actual byte order ([#4762](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4762)) 
- Make message handling in the Map panel more robust ([#4765](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4765))

**Fixed**
- Changed the Data source dialog’s behavior to immediately close after user clicks “Open” on a Velodyne LIDAR connection([#4728](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4728))
- Enabled loading `PointCloud2 messages` with fields whose count is unsupported (i.e. ≠ 1) by hiding those fields ([#4747](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4747))
