We've added a Teleop panel, as well as support for live ROS 2 Rosbridge Websocket connections!

**Added**
- Added a Teleop panel to send `geometry_msgs/Twist` messages with a configurable publish rate ([#1429](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1429), [#1663](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1663))
- Added `advertise`, `unadvertise`, and `publish` methods to the panel extensions API ([#1598](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1598))
- Added ROS 2 support to panels that support only certain datatypes (e.g. `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` in addition to `sensor_msgs/Image`), to improve compatibility with ROS 2 bags, WebSocket connections, and future native connections ([#1637](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1637))
- Added a `README.md` for `@foxglove/studio-base` ([#1644](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1644)) 
- Added ROS 2 support for Rosbridge WebSocket connections ([#1655](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1655))
- Added "Foxglove Studio" after the current data source in the titlebar title ([#1678](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1678))

**Changed**
- Detected host platform to display the correct shortcut key in the Welcome panel ([#945](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/945))
- Added a check to avoid rendering if point cloud field offsets point past the end of the byte array ([#1642](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1642))
- Improved error handling for native ROS 1 connection failures, by surfacing them as player problems ([#1643](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1643))
- Added a check for the size of ROS 1 messages before deserializing, surfacing failures as player problems or user notifications ([#1651](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1651))
- Removed in-app title bar to display connection problems as a badge on the connections icon or as text inside the connections tab ([#1677](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1677))

**Fixed**
- Fixed Legacy Plot to properly display data when read from bags and other data sources using lazy messages ([#1634](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1634)) 
- Display title and axis labels from  message on the Legacy Plot ([#1635](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1635))
- Fixed ROS 2 message parsing and deserialization, and improved error reporting ([#1636](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1636))
- Fixed issue where panels would sometimes disappear from the layout when dragged out of Tab panels ([#1647](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1647))
- Fixed an issue with performing mDNS lookups with a `@foxglove/electron-socket` update ([#1648](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1648))
- Filtered the datasets down to the configured view bounds before sending to the Plot panel ([#1649](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1649))
- Fixed ROS 1 message decoding regression with a `@foxglove/rosmsg-serialization` update ([#1669](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1669))
- Fixed ROS 1 publishing with `@foxglove/ros1` and `@foxglove/electron-socket` updates ([#1670](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1670))
- Fixed State Transitions panel to place chart items under the correct legend item ([#1672](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1672))
- Fixed styling on the Plot panel's hover bar to appear consistently on all browsers ([#1673](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1673))

**Internal**
- Removed `punycode`, a dependency for older libraries with Webpack v4, from appearing in web builds ([#1469](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1469))
- Remove unused code ([#1623](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1623), [#1650](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1650), [#1680](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1680))
- Migrate to `@foxglove/rostime` package ([#1681](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/1681))
