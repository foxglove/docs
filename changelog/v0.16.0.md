We've added a Teleop panel, as well as support for live ROS 2 Rosbridge Websocket connections!

**Added**
- Added a Teleop panel to send `geometry_msgs/Twist` messages with a configurable publish rate
- Added `advertise`, `unadvertise`, and `publish` methods to the panel extensions API
- Added ROS 2 support to panels that support only certain datatypes (e.g. `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` in addition to `sensor_msgs/Image`), to improve compatibility with ROS 2 bags, WebSocket connections, and future native connections
- Added a `README.md` for `@foxglove/studio-base` 
- Added ROS 2 support for Rosbridge WebSocket connections
- Added "Foxglove Studio" after the current data source in the titlebar title

**Changed**
- Detected host platform to display the correct shortcut key in the Welcome panel
- Added a check to avoid rendering if point cloud field offsets point past the end of the byte array
- Improved error handling for native ROS 1 connection failures, by surfacing them as player problems
- Added a check for the size of ROS 1 messages before deserializing, surfacing failures as player problems or user notifications
- Removed in-app title bar to display connection problems as a badge on the connections icon or as text inside the connections tab

**Fixed**
- Fixed Legacy Plot to properly display data when read from bags and other data sources using lazy messages 
- Display title and axis labels from  message on the Legacy Plot
- Fixed ROS 2 message parsing and deserialization, and improved error reporting
- Fixed issue where panels would sometimes disappear from the layout when dragged out of Tab panels
- Fixed an issue with performing mDNS lookups with a `@foxglove/electron-socket` update
- Filtered the datasets down to the configured view bounds before sending to the Plot panel
- Fixed ROS 1 message decoding regression with a `@foxglove/rosmsg-serialization` update
- Fixed ROS 1 publishing with `@foxglove/ros1` and `@foxglove/electron-socket` updates
- Fixed State Transitions panel to place chart items under the correct legend item
- Fixed styling on the Plot panel's hover bar to appear consistently on all browsers

**Internal**
- Removed `punycode`, a dependency for older libraries with Webpack v4, from appearing in web builds
- Remove unused code
- Migrate to `@foxglove/rostime` package
