**Added**
* Added the ability to search for message fields in the Topics sidebar, and drag & drop fields onto panels to visualize them – currently supported for Raw Messages, Image, Plot, State Transitions, and Table panels ([#6717](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6717))
* Added support for CDR-encoded messages that use XCDR1 encapsulation kinds ([#6716](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6716)) 
* Added support for `omgidl` schemas that use enumerator overrides and unions ([#6716](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6716))

**Changed**
* Moved data generation for Plot panels to a Web Worker to reduce plot generation memory usage ([#6584](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6584))
* Allow arbitrary precision in number inputs in settings fields ([#6704](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6704))
* Changed "Rotation offset" fields in the 3D panel’s “Transforms” settings to compose with the original rotation, vs adding to it ([#6711](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/6711))
