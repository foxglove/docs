**Added**
* Added the ability to search for message fields in the Topics sidebar, and drag & drop fields onto panels to visualize them – currently supported for Raw Messages, Image, Plot, State Transitions, and Table panels
* Added support for CDR-encoded messages that use XCDR1 encapsulation kinds 
* Added support for `omgidl` schemas that use enumerator overrides and unions

**Changed**
* Moved data generation for Plot panels to a Web Worker to reduce plot generation memory usage
* Allow arbitrary precision in number inputs in settings fields
* Changed "Rotation offset" fields in the 3D panel’s “Transforms” settings to compose with the original rotation, vs adding to it
