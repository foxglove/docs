**Added**

- Added the ability to set a custom variable, in addition to the default `$selected_id`, when selecting a marker in the 3D panel

**Changed**

- Added a numeric precision panel setting for the Diagnostics Details (ROS) panel
- Redesigned the _Data source_ dialog to help users learn more about Foxglove
- Changed Foxglove to no longer modify or normalize schema names when displaying them in the _Data source_ sidebar tab – [Foxglove schema](https://github.com/foxglove/schemas) names must now be fully qualified (e.g. `foxglove.Grid`, not just `Grid`)
- Added a "Planar Projection Factor" topic setting for camera frustums and images in the 3D panel’s settings

**Fixed**

- Fixed more memory leaks
- Fixed an issue on Windows where [Foxglove deep links](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/building-and-sharing-links) would open a blank Foxglove window
- Fixed an issue where [click-to-publish in the 3D panel](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/3d#publish) was always publishing with the fixed frame, even while coordinates were in the display frame
- Fixed aspect ratio for camera frustums and images in the 3D panel
- Fixed a bug where message converter extensions would not work for pre-loaded data
