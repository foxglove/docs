**Added**
- Added the ability to set a custom variable, in addition to the default `$selected_id`, when selecting a marker in the 3D panel ([#4944](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4944))

**Changed**
- Added a numeric precision panel setting for the Diagnostics Details (ROS) panel ([#4712](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4712))

- Changed Foxglove Studio to no longer modify or normalize schema names when displaying them in the _Data source_ sidebar tab – [Foxglove schema](https://github.com/foxglove/schemas) names must now be fully qualified (e.g. `foxglove.Grid`, not just `Grid`) ([#4948](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4948))

- Fixed an issue where [click-to-publish in the 3D panel](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/3d#publish) was always publishing with the fixed frame, even while coordinates were in the display frame ([#4947](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4947))
- Fixed aspect ratio for camera frustums and images in the 3D panel ([#4953](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4953))
