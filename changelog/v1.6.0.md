**Added**

- Added support for best-effort QoS mode for ROS 2 topics (`sensor_data` mode); added support for VLS-128 LIDAR sensors in the Velodyne data source
- Added support for the `/clock` topic in ROS 2 data sources; populated `MessageEvent.publishTime` for ROS 2 and MCAP data sources
- Allow extensions to access `MessageEvent.publishTime` for ROS 2 and MCAP data sources
- Properly detect COLLADA (`.dae`) mesh markers in the 3D panel if the `Content-Type` header or `data:` URL MIME type is set to "model/vnd.collada+xml"

**Changed**

- Moved information inside the Data Source Info panel into the Data source sidebar once connection is live
- Display a topic warning when `nav_msgs/Path` poses have different `frame_id`s in the 3D panel
- Simplified platform-specific app setup so that users only need one `App` component via `@foxglove/studio-base`

**Fixed**

- Fixed a bug with calibration data for VLS-128 LIDAR sensors in the 3D panel
- Fixed an issue with calculating start and end times in Foxglove player
- Fixed a bug where `enum` fields in Protobuf schemas were not usable via message path syntax
- Fixed ROS 2 native subscriptions to multiple publishers with different QoS profiles
