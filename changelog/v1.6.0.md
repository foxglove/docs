**Added**
* Added support for best-effort QoS mode for ROS 2 topics (`sensor_data` mode); added support for VLS-128 LIDAR sensors in the Velodyne data source ([#3103](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3103))
* Added support for the `/clock` topic in ROS 2 data sources; populated `MessageEvent.publishTime` for ROS 2 and MCAP data sources ([#3106](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3106))
* Allow extensions to access `MessageEvent.publishTime` for ROS 2 and MCAP data sources ([#3107](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3107))
* Properly detect COLLADA (`.dae`) mesh markers in the 3D panel if the `Content-Type` header or `data:` URL MIME type is set to "model/vnd.collada+xml" ([#3108](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3108))

**Changed**
* Moved information inside the Data Source Info panel into the Data source sidebar once connection is live ([#3060](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3060))
* Display a topic warning when `nav_msgs/Path` poses have different `frame_id`s in the 3D panel ([#3111](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3111))
* Simplified platform-specific app setup so that users only need one `App` component via `@foxglove/studio-base` ([#3114](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3114))

**Fixed**
* Fixed a bug with calibration data for VLS-128 LIDAR sensors in the 3D panel ([#3105](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3105))
* Fixed an issue with calculating start and end times in the Data Platform player ([#3121](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3121)) 
* Fixed a bug where `enum` fields in Protobuf schemas were not usable via message path syntax ([#3130](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3130))
* Fixed ROS 2 native subscriptions to multiple publishers with different QoS profiles ([#3137](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3137))
