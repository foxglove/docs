- Added support for loading MCAP files from a remote URL
- Made all built-in types available for use in the Node Playground panel, even when users' data does not contain those types
- Added `velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan` and `velodyne_msgs/VelodynePacket` to the set of built-in message types

**Changed**
- Improved error messages during MCAP reading to include information about which library produced the file
- Display message order warnings in the Data source sidebar, instead of via toast notifications
- Adjusted shaft length of pose in nuScenes sample data demo
- Improved error messages when attempting to access data from Data Platform when not logged in or logged in to the wrong organization

**Fixed**
- Include the relevant `package://` URL in the error message when failing to load a resource via a `package://` URL
- Fixed a bug in the 3D panel where `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` messages with intensities would sometimes not allow coloring by intensity
- Fixed an issue with incorrect updates to the state URL and the Data source dialog's "Recents" list
- Do not display errors when users encounter previously unseen schema/channel combinations while playing data from Data Platform
- Confirmed image annotation dropdown does not jump around between selecting options
- Fixed 3D panel flicker when using the Velodyne connection with a sensor in dual return mode
- Fixed incorrect fetching behavior for remote bag and MCAP file sources, where the app would make HTTP Range requests that were too large and beyond the end of the file
