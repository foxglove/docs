**Changed**

- Adjusted [message converter extensions](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/extensions/getting-started#message-converters) API so that the `converter` function receives the full `MessageEvent` object as a second argument
- Avoid unnecessary advertisements of client channels when using the Foxglove WebSocket connection

**Fixed**

- Fixed issue with [FlatBuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev/) data (via [MCAP files](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/connection/mcap#files) or [Foxglove WebSocket connection](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/connection/custom#foxglove-websocket)) being unable to parse tables including `struct`s
- Fixed issue with editing the [View section](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/3d#view) in the 3D panel settings
