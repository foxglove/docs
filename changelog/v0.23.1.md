**Added**

- Added a `setParameter` method to the extensions API
- Added support for basic datatypes to the Node Playground panel, even when they are not present in the data source
- Added backwards compatibility to deep-linking URLs, to support both legacy `foxglove://` and new `ds.*` URLs
- Added support for dragging and dropping folders – ROS 1 and PX4 currently open the first valid file, while ROS 2 opens multiple files

**Changed**

- Removed `DEPRECATED__ros` support from the Node Playground
- Allowed incoming `/tf` messages to reparent an existing parent-child frame connection
- Allowed 3D panel scene to be set to a non-root frame – to render objects when transforms to the root frame are missing, and to fix precision issues when coordinate frames are far from the root frame
- Reorganized desktop app's menu items across the File, Edit, and View menus
- Changed "ROS 2 Bag (local)" data source to use the `Open File`, not `Open Folder`, dialog
- Styled placeholder text in input fields to have a lower opacity

**Fixed**

- Fixed alignment of the "Change panel" menu
- Fixed subscribing to previously published "latched" topics in ROS 2
- Fixed app crashes when decoding some ROS 2 data
- Set the correct defaults for panels that are swapped in for another panel
- Fixed an issue where Plot panels would reset when topics were dynamically added or removed
- Fixed a crash when rendering `PoseStamped` topics in the 3D panel
- Fixed handling of locally initiated ROS 1 parameter updates
- Fixed a missing border between the sidebar and sidebar content
- Fixed flickering visualizations when connected to a live ROS 1 source that publishes simulated time on the `/clock` topic
- Fixed deep-linking issue to properly restore state from URLs not at the root path #2326)
