**Added**
- Added a `setParameter` method to the extensions API ([#2316](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2316))
- Added support for basic datatypes to the Node Playground panel, even when they are not present in the data source ([#2289](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2289))
- Added backwards compatibility to deep-linking URLs, to support both legacy `foxglove://` and new `ds.*` URLs ([#2294](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2294))
- Added support for dragging and dropping folders – ROS 1 and PX4 currently open the first valid file, while ROS 2 opens multiple files ([#2327](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2327))

**Changed**
- Removed `DEPRECATED__ros` support from the Node Playground ([#2293](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2293))
- Allowed incoming `/tf` messages to reparent an existing parent-child frame connection ([#2307](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2307))
- Allowed 3D panel scene to be set to a non-root frame – to render objects when transforms to the root frame are missing, and to fix precision issues when coordinate frames are far from the root frame ([#2319](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2319))
- Reorganized desktop app's menu items across the File, Edit, and View menus ([#2325](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2325))
- Changed "ROS 2 Bag (local)" data source to use the `Open File`, not `Open Folder`, dialog ([#2327](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2327))
- Styled placeholder text in input fields to have a lower opacity ([#2331](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2331))

**Fixed**
- Fixed alignment of the "Change panel" menu ([#2290](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2290))
- Fixed subscribing to previously published "latched" topics in ROS 2 ([#2291](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2291))
- Fixed app crashes when decoding some ROS 2 data ([#2291](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2291))
- Set the correct defaults for panels that are swapped in for another panel ([#2296](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2296))
- Fixed an issue where Plot panels would reset when topics were dynamically added or removed ([#2298](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2298))
- Fixed a crash when rendering `PoseStamped` topics in the 3D panel ([#2305](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2305))
- Fixed handling of locally initiated ROS 1 parameter updates ([#2314](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2314))
- Fixed a missing border between the sidebar and sidebar content ([#2315](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2315))
- Fixed flickering visualizations when connected to a live ROS 1 source that publishes simulated time on the `/clock` topic ([#2322](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2322))
- Fixed deep-linking issue to properly restore state from URLs not at the root path [#2326](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2326))
