We're excited to introduce the new Foxglove WebSocket protocol, which allows you to load and visualize your custom (non-ROS) data inside Foxglove Studio!

**Added**
- Added [Foxglove WebSocket](https://github.com/foxglove/ws-protocol#readme) data source ([#2342](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2342), [#2347](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2347))
- Added dark theme for Quick Look previews ([#2349](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2349))
- Added app version in Help sidebar ([#2348](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2348))

**Changed**
- Changed Image panel behavior to automatically select an available image topic when opened as a new panel ([#2345](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2345))
- Changed `ImageMarker` colors to use `[0,1]` range, consistent with `Marker` ([#2344](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2344))

**Fixed**
- Avoided storing recent files in `indexeddb` ([#2350](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2350))
- Loaded last used layout, if no layout was specified in the app URL ([#2335](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/2335))
