We're excited to introduce the new Foxglove WebSocket protocol, which allows you to load and visualize your custom (non-ROS) data inside Foxglove Studio!

**Added**
- Added [Foxglove WebSocket](https://github.com/foxglove/ws-protocol#readme) data source
- Added dark theme for Quick Look previews
- Added app version in Help sidebar

**Changed**
- Changed Image panel behavior to automatically select an available image topic when opened as a new panel
- Changed `ImageMarker` colors to use `[0,1]` range, consistent with `Marker`

**Fixed**
- Avoided storing recent files in `indexeddb`
- Loaded last used layout, if no layout was specified in the app URL
