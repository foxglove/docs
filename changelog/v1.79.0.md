**Added**

- Added more Japanese translations ([#7166](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7166) by [**@sachitv**](https://github.com/sachitv))

**Changed**

- Added an error message when paths in the State Transitions panel refer to array data ([#7121](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7121))
- Renamed the Call Service panel to the Service Call panel ([#7165](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7165))
- Improved rendering performance for Plot panels with large datasets ([#7167](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7167))

**Fixed**

- Correctly cleared existing data when user changes a path to an invalid value in the State Transitions panel ([#7121](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7121))
- Fixed an issue where point cloud settings in the 3D panel showed the incorrect default value ([#7162](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7162))
- Fixed an issue with `.db3` file loading errors failing to reference well-known message definitions ([#7174](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/7174))
