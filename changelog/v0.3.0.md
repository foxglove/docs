Happy release day! We're excited to bring you a selection of new treats:

#### Added

- Native ROS 1 connection support! You can now connect directly to a running rosmaster, without needing to run the rosbridge_server websocket node (which is still fully supported). ([#328](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/328))
- Better timestamp formatting in the 3D panel ([#347](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/347))
- Hid the playback bar when connected to a live robot ([#371](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/371))
- Moved Electron Developer Tools under _View -> Advanced_ menu ([#366](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/366))
- Added support for `nav_msgs/Path` ([#374](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/374))
- Added telemetry (opt-out available in `settings.json`) ([#373](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/373))

#### Changed

- Opening bags compressed with `bz2` is at least 2x faster ([#346](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/346))
- Improvements to keyboard shortcuts and undo/redo handling ([#340](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/340))
- Always use dark mode if the OS supports it, to match our app theme ([#348](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/348))
- Keep layout menu open after deleting a layout ([#367](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/367))
- Renamed `WebSocket` to `Rosbridge` in the UI ([#369](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/369))
- Lots more refactoring and improvements under the hood!

#### Fixed

- Many improvements to error handling around new connections
- Fixed bug when displaying unknown panels ([#372](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/372))
- Fixed markers not being properly deselected ([#376](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/376))
- Fixed table color inheritance ([#378](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/378))

#### Removed

- Removed the `2D Plot` panel ([#354](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/354)). This had overlapping features with the existing `Plot` panel (not to mention a confusing name), and we plan to merge their features.
