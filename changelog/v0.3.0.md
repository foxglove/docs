Happy release day! We're excited to bring you a selection of new treats:

#### Added

- Native ROS 1 connection support! You can now connect directly to a running rosmaster, without needing to run the rosbridge_server websocket node (which is still fully supported).
- Better timestamp formatting in the 3D panel
- Hid the playback bar when connected to a live robot
- Moved Electron Developer Tools under _View -> Advanced_ menu
- Added support for `nav_msgs/Path`
- Added telemetry (opt-out available in `settings.json`)

#### Changed

- Opening bags compressed with `bz2` is at least 2x faster
- Improvements to keyboard shortcuts and undo/redo handling
- Always use dark mode if the OS supports it, to match our app theme
- Keep layout menu open after deleting a layout
- Renamed `WebSocket` to `Rosbridge` in the UI
- Lots more refactoring and improvements under the hood!

#### Fixed

- Many improvements to error handling around new connections
- Fixed bug when displaying unknown panels
- Fixed markers not being properly deselected
- Fixed table color inheritance

#### Removed

- Removed the `2D Plot` panel. This had overlapping features with the existing `Plot` panel (not to mention a confusing name), and we plan to merge their features.
