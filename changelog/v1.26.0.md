With this release, we've been hard at work continuing to expand on the üÜï  3D panel:

- Added support for rendering `TriangleList` scene entity primitives ([#4418](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4418)) 
- Added support for `foxglove.RawImage`, `foxglove.CompressedImage`, and `foxglove.CameraCalibration` messages ([#4425](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4425)) 
- Added ability to manually edit transform poses ([#4445](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4445)) 
- Added ability to filter topics by visibility ([#4460](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4460)) 

Some other highlights:

**Added**
- Added support for reading unindexed MCAP files ([#4391](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4391)) 
- Added ability to create Foxglove Data Platform events directly in Foxglove Studio ([#4401](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4401)) 
- Added support for more ROS 2 message types for live ROS 2 connections and `.db3` files ([#4408](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4408))
- Added a setting to State Transitions panels that allows users to sync them with other plots in the layout ([#4428](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4428)) 

**Changed**
- Improved horizontal scaling of panel settings editor fields ([#4402](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4402)) 
- Made minor improvements for large messages in the ROS 2 native connector ([#4438](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4438)) 
- Improved playback caching for file and streaming data sources ([#4472](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4472)) 

**Fixed**
- Fixed an issue where opening a file with a message at epoch time second 0 and other messages at ‚Äúnow‚Äù would make Studio hang ([#4398](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4398)) 
- Fixed a bug in the 3D panel where `foxglove.LaserScan` messages' locations were not being updated properly ([#4427](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4427)) 
- Fixed a bug where an extension panel would be able to asynchronously subscribe to new topics or otherwise change application state, even after being removed from the layout ([#4436](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4436)) 
- Fixed handling of COLLADA `<up_axis>` tags for loaded `.dae` files, and added a 3D panel setting for ignoring COLLADA <up_axis> tags to match Rviz behavior ([#4442](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4442)) 
- Fixed streaming from Data Platform when there are gaps in coverage ([#4449](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4449))
- Fixed an issue where user scripts would sometimes fail to run after loading a data source ([#4455](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/4455))
