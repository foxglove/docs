With this release, we've been hard at work continuing to expand on the üÜï  3D panel:

- Added support for rendering `TriangleList` scene entity primitives 
- Added support for `foxglove.RawImage`, `foxglove.CompressedImage`, and `foxglove.CameraCalibration` messages 
- Added ability to manually edit transform poses 
- Added ability to filter topics by visibility 

Some other highlights:

**Added**
- Added support for reading unindexed MCAP files 
- Added ability to create Foxglove Data Platform events directly in Foxglove Studio 
- Added support for more ROS 2 message types for live ROS 2 connections and `.db3` files
- Added a setting to State Transitions panels that allows users to sync them with other plots in the layout 

**Changed**
- Improved horizontal scaling of panel settings editor fields 
- Made minor improvements for large messages in the ROS 2 native connector 
- Improved playback caching for file and streaming data sources 

**Fixed**
- Fixed an issue where opening a file with a message at epoch time second 0 and other messages at ‚Äúnow‚Äù would make Studio hang 
- Fixed a bug in the 3D panel where `foxglove.LaserScan` messages' locations were not being updated properly 
- Fixed a bug where an extension panel would be able to asynchronously subscribe to new topics or otherwise change application state, even after being removed from the layout 
- Fixed handling of COLLADA `<up_axis>` tags for loaded `.dae` files, and added a 3D panel setting for ignoring COLLADA <up_axis> tags to match Rviz behavior 
- Fixed streaming from Data Platform when there are gaps in coverage
- Fixed an issue where user scripts would sometimes fail to run after loading a data source
