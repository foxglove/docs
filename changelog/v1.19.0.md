**Added**
- Added support for preloading and plotting the message outputs of Node Playground panel scripts ([#3721](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3721))
- Added support for `file://` URLs in `MESH_RESOURCE` markers and URDF models ([#3928](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3928))

**Changed**
- No longer display message frequency for topics with a single message in the Data source sidebar tab ([#3866](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3866))
- Reorganized panel settings and added an error message for image topics when the associated `CameraInfo` topic is not found in the 3D (Beta) panel ([#3896](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3896))
- Deleted the experimental feature for "Unlimited in-memory cache", as it is no longer useful and will likely lead to app crashes or slowdowns ([#3904](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3904))

**Fixed**
- Fixed a crash in Diagnostic panels when an unsupported datatype is published on the `/diagnostic` topic ([#3874](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3874))
- Fixed a bug in the 3D (Beta) panel where seeking would sometimes result in orientation changes if a transform frame had not been manually selected ([#3885](https://github.com/foxglove/studio/pull/3885))
