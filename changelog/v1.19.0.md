**Added**
- Added support for preloading and plotting the message outputs of Node Playground panel scripts
- Added support for `file://` URLs in `MESH_RESOURCE` markers and URDF models

**Changed**
- No longer display message frequency for topics with a single message in the Data source sidebar tab
- Reorganized panel settings and added an error message for image topics when the associated `CameraInfo` topic is not found in the 3D (Beta) panel
- Deleted the experimental feature for "Unlimited in-memory cache", as it is no longer useful and will likely lead to app crashes or slowdowns

**Fixed**
- Fixed a crash in Diagnostic panels when an unsupported datatype is published on the `/diagnostic` topic
- Fixed a bug in the 3D (Beta) panel where seeking would sometimes result in orientation changes if a transform frame had not been manually selected
