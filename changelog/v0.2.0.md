It's that time of the week again! Here's what we've been working on:

#### Added

- Layout management! No longer are you constrained to a single layout. You can now save multiple layouts for different purposes, and easily switch between them. You can also import/export layouts as json files to share with friends.
- New _Welcome_ layout and panel, explaining how to get started with Foxglove Studio.

#### Fixed

- Fixed various issues regarding missing `tf` frames, preventing prominent open source bags from loading in the 3D panel

#### Removed

- We removed the `Note` panel. We plan to investigate better ways of annotating layouts.
